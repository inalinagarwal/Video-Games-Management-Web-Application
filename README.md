#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/LMH_pL2toAg>
#### Description:
This is my CS50's final project web application. I used all of the things I learnt in this 9 week long course to build this project.
####
As an avid gamer, it is always hard to keep track of all the games that I want to play, or I have played. This web application makes life easier. I can add the games that I want to play, on any platform, and maintain a playlist, which I can delete games from, after I have finished them. Welcome to the Gamer's Paradise, a user-friendly web application designed to streamline the organization of your gaming experience. Developed using HTML, CSS, Flask, and SQL technologies, this application empowers users to effortlessly add and delete games from their personalized playlists, ensuring a seamless and personalized gaming journey.
####
The application boasts a clean and intuitive user interface, providing users with a straightforward experience. The minimalist design ensures easy navigation, making it accessible for both novice and experienced gamers.
Users can effortlessly add their favorite games to their playlists. The dynamic interface allows for quick entry of game details, including the title and the platform. The system ensures that each game is accurately cataloged for easy retrieval.
The heart of the application lies in its playlist management capabilities. Users can view, edit, and delete games from their playlists, tailoring their gaming library to suit their preferences. Whether you're a casual gamer or a dedicated enthusiast, the Gamer's Paradise adapts to your needs.
Security is a top priority. The application incorporates robust user authentication to protect user data and ensure a safe and private experience. Passwords are securely hashed, and user sessions are managed to prevent unauthorized access.
The backend of the application is powered by Flask and SQL, providing a scalable and efficient database management system. This ensures that your game playlists are stored securely and can be easily retrieved whenever you log in.
Not only that, I can also seek information about any specific game, as the application lands me to the game's wikipedia page, which contains all the required information like gameplay, reviews, the basic story, and so on.
(Props to wikipedia for such wonderful information provided for free!)
####
So my web application has mainly 6 pages -> login, register, information, add, delete and list.
All pages are explanable by themselves.
