# GAMER'S PARADISE
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/LMH_pL2toAg>
#### Description:
This is my CS50's final project web application. I used all of the things I learnt in this 9 week long course to build this project. This web application is built using HTML, CSS, Flask and SQL. 
####
As an avid gamer, it is always hard to keep track of all the games that I want to play, or I have played. This web application makes life easier. I can add the games that I want to play, on any platform, and maintain a playlist, which I can delete games from, after I have finished them.
####
Not only that, I can also seek information about any specific game, as the application lands me to the game's wikipedia page, which contains all the required information like gameplay, reviews, the basic story, and so on.
(Props to wikipedia for such wonderful information provided for free!)
####
So my web application has mainly 6 pages -> login, register, information, add, delete and list.
All pages are explanable by themselves. 
####
Login, Register pages help in authentication, as my web application can be accessed by any number of users, and all of them can create their own playlists on my app.
####
Information pages lets you find any game and its subsequent wikipedia page for reference.
####
Add and Delete pages help you add or remove specific games from your playlist, this is the main part of the app, as it helps you maintain the playlist.
####
The list page displays your playlist, indicating each game, its platform and the link for information page as well.
